# Chapter 5
## Where to go from here?

If you have come this far, it means that you are now familiar with basic terminologies of the deep learning world. I hope that this book has served you well in acquainting you with the deep learning world and a little bit with pyTorch.

Now, Following is how I will advise you to advance in this field - 

1. Start with [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) MOOCs.
2. Alongwith Fast ai's courses, keep reading [lecture notes](http://cs231n.github.io/) from Andrej Karpathy.
3. Once you are comfortable with Jeremy Howard's Fast Ai. Start [CS 231n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfnWJUyUJYU&list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC).
4. I'd also suggest you to dive in Machine Learning world now. [CS 229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E&list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599).

The resources mentioned above should give you a great boost in your learning journey.

Once you find yourself ready to take challenges then you can read - 
- Neural Networks & Learning Machines - Simon Haykin
- [Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) - Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville

Along the way, try to keep track on the popular papers which are released 
- CVPR
- NeurIPS
- ICML 

Honestly, I have lost the track here. 250+ papers were released this year.
